Important things to do:
message sanitization (limit to printable ascii characters)
message timestamps (we can just do GMT unix time and convert on display)

Minor things to add that will be forgotten:
Userfile backups
Account shutdown in the case of hijacks
"online" friends
switch to pthread_rwlock
