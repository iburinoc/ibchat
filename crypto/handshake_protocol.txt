handshake protocol
==================
this protocol assumes 2048-bit rsa and diffie-hellman keys are used
group 14 as identified in rfc3526 is used for key exchange
the keyset is obtained using pbkdf2_hmac_sha256
the number agreed upon via diffie-hellman is converted to an octal string
using i2osp, prefixed by the length as 8 big-endian bytes,
and then used as the password for pbkdf2
the salt is the empty string, and 1 iteration is used

client->server
	0x000-0x008 length of public key
	0x008-0x108 g^b mod p

server->client
0x000-0x008 length of rsa-public key
	rsa public key:
	0x000-0x110 rsa public key, in form specified by ibcrypt

X-X+0x8     length of diffie-hellman public key
	diffie-hellman key:
	0x000-0x008 length of public key
	0x008-0x108 g^a mod p
Y-Y+0x020    hash of keybuf
Z-Z+0x100    signature of entire above message using private key

0x80 bytes are extracted from pbkdf2 using the empty string as the salt,
and the length-prefixed octal string representation of g^(ab) mod p

key buf:
0x000-0x020 client->server symmetric key
0x020-0x040 server->client symmetric key
0x040-0x060 client hmac key
0x060-0x080 server hmac key

once this is complete, they are connected, and may communicate according to the
ibchat application layer protocol
